first initialize git init 
then check the git status
stage the file using " git add "filename" "
to commit use the command " git commit -m "message" " to add a message
the message should be in present tense by convention
to check the commit type ""git log""
once done if the file content gets altered 
can do one thing that is "git diff {filename}" to see what changes
if want to go back use the command "git checkout {filename}"
